## Finance Tracker

This project is a responsive landing page designed for a Finance Tracker app. It was built using the Bootstrap framework and includes three main sections: the Call-out, Reviews and Features sections. A sales alert is displayed prominently at the top of the page, and a navigation menu is located below it.
The page is fully responsive, meaning that it can adjust its layout and content to fit any screen size, making it accessible and user-friendly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

I created this mini project with the purpose to learn functionalities of the Bootstrap framework. It is based on one of the walkthrough projects from Code Institute.
